## üóìÔ∏è Day 1 (11/June/2025) ‚Äì Project Kickoff

- Created folder `path_planner_sim` and opened it in VS Code
- I had Python already installed from other projects, but I installed Pygame (`pip install pygame`)
- Verified Pygame setup with an example run

- Created `main.py` with:
  - 600√ó600 Pygame window
  - 30√ó30 grid using vertical and horizontal lines
  - Dynamic cell sizing using `CELL_SIZE`
  - 60 FPS main loop for smooth visuals
  - Clean structure: config, init, draw, main loop

- Project now displays a static, well-aligned grid as a simulation base
